- 👋 Hi, I’m Yikai.
- 👀 I’m currently a PhD student from Operational Research Group. My research topic involves multiple objective optimisation and hyper-heuristics for scheduling problems.
- 🌱 I started to share my learning process in Nov 2021. My recent interests include SQL and Python. I teach these two programming languages myself. Also, I would like to go over the knowledge about Statistics. My current research also needs to use a lot of hypothesis testing contents.
- 💞️ I hope my learning notes can help you. In the future, I will share my own project here.
