# Interpretable Risk Rule Engine

This repository contains a Python-based framework for building, optimising and executing **interpretable risk rules** from structured data.

The system supports feature selection, expert-constrained rule generation and business-aware optimisation for use in fraud, credit and compliance decisioning workflows.

---

## Purpose

The engine is designed to:

- Prepare and validate raw input data  
- Identify stable and interpretable risk features  
- Generate candidate risk rules under expert and monotonic constraints  
- Optimise rule sets under configurable business objectives  
- Execute and evaluate rules with full transparency and traceability  

The framework prioritises **explainability, governance and reproducibility** over black-box performance.

## Main Components

- **Data preparation** — cleaning, missing value imputation and schema validation  
- **Feature selection** — statistical screening, correlation control and optional model-based importance with expert sign constraints  
- **Rule construction** — automatic generation of 1D / 2D / 3D interpretable rules  
- **Rule optimisation** — greedy and heuristic search under risk, loss and coverage constraints  
- **Evaluation & visualisation** — baseline comparison, redundancy checks and performance diagnostics  
- **Execution engine** — deterministic application of approved rules to new data  

---

## Usage

Typical workflow:

1. Prepare and validate input data  
2. Run feature selection with expert constraints  
3. Generate and optimise candidate rule sets  
4. Review rule performance and redundancy diagnostics  
5. Export approved rules and apply to production data  

Detailed examples and configuration files are provided in the `notebooks/` and `examples/` directories.

## Governance & Safety

- All rules are stored in a portable, versioned format  
- Execution is deterministic and fully auditable  
- Business thresholds, objectives and expert constraints are configurable  
- Example datasets and sensitive configurations are intentionally excluded
